# models Feature

## What This Feature Does
Shared SQLAlchemy domain models used across API features.

## Install And Runtime Requirements
Install dependencies from repository root:
```bash
pipenv install
```
Relevant packages for this feature:
- flask
- flask-sqlalchemy
- flask-migrate
- marshmallow
- flask-jwt-extended
- python-dotenv
- alembic

Apply migrations before testing API endpoints:
```bash
pipenv run flask --app main db upgrade
```
Start local API:
```bash
FLASK_APP=main.py pipenv run flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
```

## Test Setup
```bash
export BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
export JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<paste-valid-jwt>
export USER_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
```

## Endpoint Testing
This feature has no direct HTTP routes in this folder; it is consumed by other routed modules.

## Notes
- Replace placeholder UUIDs/tokens with real values from your seeded environment.
- For admin-only endpoints, use a token that has required RBAC permissions.
- For webhook endpoints, use provider-generated signatures in non-local testing.
